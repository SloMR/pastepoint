## üîß Development Guide

### üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (v22.4.0 as specified in `.nvmrc`)
- Rust (Nightly, specified in `rust-toolchain`)

#### Windows-Specific Requirements:

- Windows 10/11 with WSL2 enabled
- Docker Desktop for Windows
- Git Bash or PowerShell 7+ for running scripts
- OpenSSL installed via `winget install OpenSSL`

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SloMR/pastepoint.git
   cd pastepoint
   ```

2. Generate SSL certificates (required for HTTPS):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-certs.sh
   ```

3. Configure for Local Network (Optional):
   If you want to run PastePoint on your local network instead of just localhost:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/configure-network.sh
   ```

   This will prompt you to enter your local IP address and update all necessary configuration files.

4. Build and Start Services:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

5. Access PastePoint:
   - üîó Frontend:
     - Localhost: [https://localhost](https://localhost)
     - Local Network: `https://<your-local-ip>`
   - üîå Backend API:
     - Localhost: [https://localhost:9000](https://localhost:9000)
     - Local Network: `https://<your-local-ip>:9000`
   - üè• Health Check:
     - Localhost: [https://localhost/health](https://localhost/health)
     - Local Network: `https://<your-local-ip>/health`

### Environment Variables:

- `CERT_PATH`: Path to SSL certificates (default: `/etc/ssl/pastepoint`)
- `CERT_MOUNT`: Certificate mount point in containers (default: `pastepoint`)
- `SERVER_NAME`: Server name for SSL (default: `pastepoint.com www.pastepoint.com`)
- `RUST_BUILD_MODE`: Rust build mode (default: `release`)
- `NPM_BUILD_CONFIG`: NPM build configuration (default: `docker`)
- `SERVER_ENV`: Server environment (default: `production`)

### Backend Development (Rust):

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Build and run the server:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo run
   ```

### Frontend Development (Angular):

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

### Testing:

- **Backend Tests**:
  ```bash
  cargo test
  ```
- **Frontend Tests**:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

### Environment Configuration

- **Backend**:
  - `server/config/*.toml`: Update configurations for development and production environments.
- **Frontend**:
  - `client/src/environments/*`: Update environment variables for development and production.

## üö® Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

1. SSL Certificate Errors
   Run: `./scripts/generate-certs.sh`

2. Local Network Access Issues
   - Ensure your firewall allows connections on ports 80 and 443
   - Verify your local IP address is correctly configured using `./scripts/configure-network.sh`
   - Check that all services are running with `docker compose ps`
   - Verify SSL certificates are properly mounted in the containers

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Certificate Management**:

  - Replace self-signed certificates with proper SSL certificates in production
  - Keep private keys secure and never commit them to version control

- **Data Privacy**:
  - All file transfers are encrypted end-to-end
  - No data is stored permanently on servers
  - Session data is cleared on server restart or leaving the session

## üíæ Backup and Data Persistence

- **Session Data**: Ephemeral, cleared on restart or leaving the session
- **Configuration**:
  - Store SSL certificates securely
  - Version control for environment files

## üîÑ Version Compatibility

| Component | Minimum Version | Recommended Version | Notes                          |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |

  - CPU: 4+ cores recommended
  - RAM: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
  - Storage: SSD recommended for Docker containers

- **Network**:
  - Gigabit Ethernet recommended
